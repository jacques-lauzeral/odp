## Implementation Principles

### Development Approach
- **Incremental delivery**: Each phase delivers working functionality
- **Pattern reuse**: Establish patterns in Phase 1, replicate in subsequent phases
- **Manual routes consistency**: Follow Routes â†’ Services â†’ Store â†’ Neo4j pattern for all entities
- **CLI validation**: Each entity's CLI commands validate all API operations
- **Complexity graduation**: Setup entities â†’ Versioned entities â†’ Complex management entities

### Technical Standards
- **Manual routes**: Direct Express route files for clear, maintainable API implementation
- **Transaction management**: Explicit boundaries with proper error handling across all entities
- **Shared models**: Consistent data structures across CLI, Server, and Web Client
- **Docker development**: Containerized environment for all development
- **ES modules**: Consistent module system throughout all components
- **Versioning pattern**: Item/ItemVersion dual-node approach for operational entities

### Quality Gates per Phase
- **Working endpoints**: Full CRUD operations with proper error handling
- **CLI validation**: Command-line interface tests all API functionality for each entity
- **Documentation**: Updated implementation guides and patterns
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end workflow validation across all layers

### Entity Implementation Pattern (Phases 2-4)
For each new entity, follow this proven pattern:
1. **Shared Models**: Add entity definition to `@odp/shared`
2. **Store Layer**: Create entity store extending appropriate base class (BaseStore/VersionedItemStore)
3. **Service Layer**: Implement business logic with transaction management
4. **Route Layer**: Create Express routes file with CRUD operations
5. **Server Integration**: Add routes to main server application
6. **CLI Commands**: Create command handlers using direct HTTP calls
7. **Testing**: Validate all operations via CLI and direct API calls

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Criteria
- All planned entities implemented with full CRUD operations
- CLI commands provide complete functionality coverage for all entities
- Web client offers intuitive user experience for all operational workflows
- Baseline management enables reliable deployment planning
- System demonstrates complete operational deployment plan lifecycle

### Technical Achievement
- Scalable manual routes architecture supporting unlimited entity expansion
- Robust versioning and baseline management for operational entities
- Clean separation between setup data and operational data
- Efficient Neo4j utilization with proper relationship management
- Consistent patterns that enable rapid development of future entities

## Current Status Summary

**âœ… Completed Phases**: 1-2 (Setup + Setup Entities)
**ðŸ”„ Current Phase**: 3 (Operational Entities) - Store Layer Complete, Service Layer Next
**ðŸ“ˆ Overall Progress**: ~40% complete
**ðŸŽ¯ Next Milestone**: Complete Phase 3 Service + Route layers to enable operational entity management

**Key Achievements in Phase 3**:
- Robust versioning pattern with optimistic locking
- Simplified storage model eliminating complexity
- Complete store layer with versioned entity support
- Comprehensive documentation for future development

This work plan maintains the successful manual routes approach established in Phase 1 while providing a clear roadmap for comprehensive ODP functionality across all planned phases.
