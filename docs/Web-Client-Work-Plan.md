2. ðŸ“‹ **Requirements root**: Entity container ready for Collection perspective integration
3. ðŸ“‹ **Changes root**: Entity container with milestone and relationship awareness
4. ðŸ“‹ **Integration testing**: Deep linking, state preservation, and navigation consistency

**Success metrics**: Envelope components provide solid foundation for Collection perspective implementation, with clear separation between container logic and content rendering.
