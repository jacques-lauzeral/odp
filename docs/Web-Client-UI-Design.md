**Last Updated**: July 21, 2025

---

## Application Architecture

### Three-Layer Page Structure
The ODP Web Client follows a consistent three-layer navigation hierarchy across all activities:

**Layer 1: ODP Level (Global Application Chrome)**
- Persistent header across all activities: `Landing | Setup | Read | Elaboration`
- User context display and connection status
- Consistent application-wide navigation

**Layer 2: Activity Level (Activity-Specific Workspace)**
- Activity-specific navigation and layout patterns
- Context management within each activity
- Activity-focused toolbars and controls

**Layer 3: Entity Level (Entity-Specific Interactions)**
- CRUD operations and detailed entity management
- Context-sensitive actions based on current selection
- Entity-specific validation and relationships

---

## Activity UI Specifications

### Landing Page
**Purpose**: Simple activity launcher with user identification

**Layout**:
- Clean, minimal interface with three activity tiles
- User identification prompt (name entry, no authentication)
- Connection status indicator
- Direct navigation to Setup, Read, or Elaboration activities

---

### Setup Management Activity
**Purpose**: Entity management interface for reference data configuration

#### Activity Structure (Layer 2)
**Entity Navigation Tabs**:
- `Stakeholder Categories | Regulatory Aspects | Data Categories | Services | Waves`
- Tab-based switching between entity types
- Entity count badges on each tab
- Responsive horizontal scroll on mobile

**Layout Pattern**: Three-pane workspace for all setup entities

#### Entity Management Pattern (Layer 3)
**Left Pane: Entity Tree**
- Collapsible hierarchy tree for REFINES relationships
- Visual indicators: `‚ñ∂` (expandable), `‚îî‚îÄ` (child), indentation levels
- Click to select any node in hierarchy
- Real-time tree updates when entities are added/modified

**Center Pane: Detail/Editor**
- **View Mode**: Read-only display of selected entity
- **Edit Mode**: Form-based editing with validation
- Toggle between view/edit modes
- Auto-focus when creating new entities

**Top Toolbar: Actions**
- **Entity Actions**: Add Child | Edit | Delete (context-sensitive)
- **Bulk Actions**: Import | Export | Validate Hierarchy
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumb showing current entity path

#### REFINES Hierarchy Management
**Visual Representation**:
- Tree structure with expand/collapse controls
- Clear parent-child relationships through indentation
- Status badges: "Hierarchy Root" | "Child Entity" | "Standalone"

**Interaction Patterns**:
- **Create Child**: Auto-select parent, open editor for new child
- **Parent Selection**: Dropdown with hierarchy validation (prevent circular references)
- **Tree Navigation**: Click any node to view/edit that entity
- **Breadcrumb**: Show hierarchy path for current selection

#### Entity-Specific Patterns

**Stakeholder Categories** (Reference Implementation):
- Full REFINES hierarchy support
- Name, description fields
- Parent selection with validation
- Child count display

**Regulatory Aspects**:
- REFINES hierarchy support
- Name/title, description, regulation reference fields
- Similar tree patterns as StakeholderCategories

**Data Categories**:
- REFINES hierarchy support
- Name, description fields for data classification
- Tree navigation patterns

**Services**:
- REFINES hierarchy support
- Name, description, domain associations
- User/stakeholder category relationships

**Waves**:
- **Simple list pattern** (no REFINES hierarchy)
- Year, quarter, optional date fields
- Chronological sorting (most recent first)
- Validation: quarter 1-4, future dates only

## ODP Browser/Navigator Component
**Purpose**: Unified browsing component for operational content across Read, Elaboration, and Review activities

### Component Architecture
**Unified Design**: Single component serves multiple activities with configurable modes and perspectives

**Configuration Interface**:
```javascript
<ODPBrowser 
  context={{type: "edition|baseline|repository", id: "123"}}
  mode="elaboration|read|internal-review|external-comment"
  perspective="hierarchical|temporal"
  user={{permissions: [...], role: "..."}}
/>
```

### Content Context Selection
**Three Entry Points**:
- **ODP Edition** (primary): Published editions for formal review and consultation
- **Baseline** (advanced): Historical snapshots for cross-time analysis
- **Repository** (contributors): Live development content with latest versions

**Context Selector**: Dropdown interface with edition metadata (status, publication date, version)

### Mode Configurations
**Elaboration Mode**: Full CRUD operations on repository content
- Create, edit, delete operational requirements and changes
- Hierarchy management with REFINES relationships
- Version control and milestone management

**Read Mode**: View-only navigation for published editions
- Browse content structure and relationships
- Export and print capabilities
- Historical version access

**Internal Review Mode**: Review capabilities for internal stakeholders
- Content browsing with comment threading
- Review status controls and approval workflow
- Internal stakeholder notification system

**External Comment Mode**: Limited commenting for external stakeholders
- Content browsing with comment submission
- Comment threading without status changes
- Public consultation workflow support

### Dual Perspective Design
**Perspective Toggle**: Clear switching between two distinct navigation approaches

**Hierarchical Perspective (üìÅ)**:
- Two-root structure: `Operational Requirements | Operational Changes`
- Tree navigation with REFINES relationship display
- Three-pane layout: tabs | tree | details
- Reuses proven Setup Activity TreeEntity patterns

**Temporal Perspective (üìÖ)**:
- Timeline visualization of deployment schedule
- Wave and milestone-based filtering
- Chronological view of content evolution
- Integration with deployment planning tools

### Layout Specifications

#### Hierarchical Perspective Layout
**Activity Structure (Layer 2)**:
- Content context selector (Edition/Baseline/Repository)
- Perspective toggle: `üìÅ Hierarchy | üìÖ Timeline`
- Entity navigation tabs: `Operational Requirements | Operational Changes`
- Mode-specific action toolbar

**Entity Navigation Pattern (Layer 3)**:
- **Left Pane**: Hierarchical tree with REFINES relationships
- **Center Pane**: Entity details with versioning information
- **Action Toolbar**: Mode-specific operations (view/edit/comment/status)

**Tree Interaction**:
- Collapsible hierarchy with visual relationship indicators
- Click-to-select with persistent selection across mode changes
- Context-sensitive actions based on selection and permissions

#### Temporal Perspective Layout
**Timeline Visualization Area**:
- Horizontal timeline with wave and milestone markers
- Interactive timeline controls for date range selection
- Entity placement on timeline based on milestone associations

**Timeline Integration**:
- Same entity detail pane as hierarchical perspective
- Timeline-specific actions: milestone shifts, wave reassignments
- Deployment schedule visualization with dependency tracking

### Action System Design
**Mode-Specific Toolbars**:
- **Elaboration**: Create, Edit, Delete, Add Child, Version Management
- **Read**: View Details, Export, Print, Version History
- **Review**: Comment, Set Status, Mark Reviewed, View Comments
- **Comment**: Add Comment, View Thread, Reply to Comments

**Perspective-Specific Actions**:
- **Hierarchical**: Hierarchy management, parent/child operations
- **Temporal**: Timeline operations, milestone management, schedule adjustments

**Context-Sensitive Behavior**:
- Actions availability based on user permissions and content context
- Visual feedback for disabled actions with explanatory tooltips
- Bulk operation support where applicable

### Read Activity
**Purpose**: Query and browse interface for operational content using ODP Browser in read-only mode

**Implementation**: ODP Browser component configured for read-only access
```javascript
<ODPBrowser 
  context={{type: "edition", id: selectedEditionId}}
  mode="read"
  perspective="hierarchical"
  user={{permissions: ["view", "export"], role: "reader"}}
/>
```

**Primary User Flow**:
1. Select ODP Edition from available published editions
2. Browse content using hierarchical or temporal perspectives
3. Access entity details and version history
4. Export or print content as needed

---

### Elaboration Activity
**Purpose**: Content creation and editing workspace using ODP Browser with full edit capabilities

<ODPBrowser 
  context={{type: "repository", id: "current"}}
  mode="elaboration"
  perspective="hierarchical"
  user={{permissions: ["view", "create", "edit", "delete"], role: "contributor"}}
/>
```

**Primary User Flow**:
1. Access repository content for editing
2. Create, edit, and organize operational requirements and changes
3. Manage REFINES hierarchies and version control
4. Use temporal perspective for deployment planning

---

### Review Activities
**Purpose**: Internal review and external commenting using ODP Browser with review capabilities

**Internal Review Implementation**:
```javascript
<ODPBrowser 
  context={{type: "edition", id: reviewEditionId}}
  mode="internal-review"
  perspective="hierarchical"
  user={{permissions: ["view", "comment", "status"], role: "internal-reviewer"}}
/>
```

**External Comment Implementation**:
```javascript
<ODPBrowser 
  context={{type: "edition", id: publishedEditionId}}
  mode="external-comment"
  perspective="hierarchical"
  user={{permissions: ["view", "comment"], role: "external-commenter"}}
/>
```
