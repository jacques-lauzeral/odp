# ODP Web Client UI Design - Initial Requirements

## Document Overview
**Purpose**: Capture UI design decisions and requirements for the ODP Web Client  
**Status**: Initial draft from conversation on [current date]  
**Next Steps**: Iterative refinement of each activity UI

---

## Core Requirements Summary

### Priority Activities (Phase 1)
1. **Setup Management Activity** - Entity configuration workspace
2. **ODP Read Activity** - Query and browse interface
3. **ODP Elaboration Activity** - Content creation and editing workspace

### Key Design Principles
- **Separate root views** for each activity with navigation between them
- **Landing page as launcher** - simple activity selection without dashboard complexity
- **Deep-linkable architecture** - users can share direct links to specific entities/views
- **Minimal collaboration conflicts** - few contributor interferences expected
- **Rich text editing requirements** - to be defined in future iterations

---

## High-Level Architecture

### Navigation Structure
```
Landing Page (Launcher)
├── Setup Management
├── ODP Read  
└── ODP Elaboration
```

### Context and State Management
- **Context preservation** when switching between views
- **URL-based deep linking** for shareability
- **Bookmarkable references** to specific entities

### URL Structure Examples
- `/setup/stakeholder-categories/123` - specific stakeholder category
- `/read/edition/456/requirements` - requirements in specific edition
- `/elaboration/folders/789/requirements/234` - editing specific requirement

---

## Activity UI Concepts

### Landing Page
- **Simple launcher interface** with three activity tiles
- **User identification prompt** - request user to enter their name (no authentication, prototype approach)
- **Clean, minimal layout** focused on navigation
- **Future enhancement**: notifications (not current scope)

### Setup Management UI (Concept)
- Entity type tabs (Stakeholder Categories, Data Categories, etc.)
- Simple CRUD forms with hierarchy management
- Quick reference lists for consistency

### ODP Read UI (Concept)
- Edition selector with status indicators
- Multi-faceted search/filter capabilities
- Results with drill-down detail panels

### ODP Elaboration UI (Concept)
- Dual-pane layout (folder tree + content editor)
- Versioned entity editor with relationship management
- Baseline and edition management tools

## Open Questions for Next Iteration
1. Which activity UI to design first?
2. Specific rich text editing requirements and capabilities
3. Permission boundaries between activities
4. Context handoff patterns between views

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Select first activity UI for detailed design
- [ ] Define URL routing structure
- [ ] Specify context preservation requirements
- [ ] Detail rich text editing needs
