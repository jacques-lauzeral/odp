# ODP Web Client UI Design

## Document Overview
**Purpose**: UI design specifications and architectural patterns for the ODP Web Client  
**Status**: Setup Management Activity complete, ODP Browser/Navigator architecture defined with Collection perspective as default  
**Last Updated**: July 27, 2025

---

## Application Architecture

### Three-Layer Page Structure
The ODP Web Client follows a consistent three-layer navigation hierarchy across all activities:

**Layer 1: ODP Level (Global Application Chrome)**
- Persistent header across all activities: `Landing | Setup | Read | Elaboration`
- User context display and connection status
- Consistent application-wide navigation

**Layer 2: Activity Level (Activity-Specific Workspace)**
- Activity-specific navigation and layout patterns
- Context management within each activity
- Activity-focused toolbars and controls

**Layer 3: Entity Level (Entity-Specific Interactions)**
- CRUD operations and detailed entity management
- Context-sensitive actions based on current selection
- Entity-specific validation and relationships

---

## Activity UI Specifications

### Landing Page
**Purpose**: Simple activity launcher with user identification

**Layout**:
- Clean, minimal interface with three activity tiles
- User identification prompt (name entry, no authentication)
- Connection status indicator
- Direct navigation to Setup, Read, or Elaboration activities

---

### Setup Management Activity
**Purpose**: Entity management interface for reference data configuration

#### Activity Structure (Layer 2)
**Entity Navigation Tabs**:
- `Stakeholder Categories | Regulatory Aspects | Data Categories | Services | Waves`
- Tab-based switching between entity types
- Entity count badges on each tab
- Responsive horizontal scroll on mobile

**Layout Pattern**: Three-pane workspace for all setup entities

#### Entity Management Pattern (Layer 3)
**Left Pane: Entity Tree**
- Collapsible hierarchy tree for REFINES relationships
- Visual indicators: `‚ñ∂` (expandable), `‚îî‚îÄ` (child), indentation levels
- Click to select any node in hierarchy
- Real-time tree updates when entities are added/modified

**Center Pane: Detail/Editor**
- **View Mode**: Read-only display of selected entity
- **Edit Mode**: Form-based editing with validation
- Toggle between view/edit modes
- Auto-focus when creating new entities

**Top Toolbar: Actions**
- **Entity Actions**: Add Child | Edit | Delete (context-sensitive)
- **Bulk Actions**: Import | Export | Validate Hierarchy
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumb showing current entity path

#### REFINES Hierarchy Management
**Visual Representation**:
- Tree structure with expand/collapse controls
- Clear parent-child relationships through indentation
- Status badges: "Hierarchy Root" | "Child Entity" | "Standalone"

**Interaction Patterns**:
- **Create Child**: Auto-select parent, open editor for new child
- **Parent Selection**: Dropdown with hierarchy validation (prevent circular references)
- **Tree Navigation**: Click any node to view/edit that entity
- **Breadcrumb**: Show hierarchy path for current selection

#### Entity-Specific Patterns

**Stakeholder Categories** (Reference Implementation):
- Full REFINES hierarchy support
- Name, description fields
- Parent selection with validation
- Child count display

**Regulatory Aspects**:
- REFINES hierarchy support
- Name/title, description, regulation reference fields
- Similar tree patterns as StakeholderCategories

**Data Categories**:
- REFINES hierarchy support
- Name, description fields for data classification
- Tree navigation patterns

**Services**:
- REFINES hierarchy support
- Name, description, domain associations
- User/stakeholder category relationships

**Waves**:
- **Simple list pattern** (no REFINES hierarchy)
- Year, quarter, optional date fields
- Chronological sorting (most recent first)
- Validation: quarter 1-4, future dates only

## ODP Browser/Navigator Component
**Purpose**: Unified browsing component for operational content across Read, Elaboration, and Review activities

### Component Architecture
**Unified Design**: Single component serves multiple activities with configurable modes and perspectives

**Configuration Interface**:
```javascript
<ODPBrowser 
  context={{type: "edition|baseline|repository", id: "123"}}
  mode="elaboration|read|internal-review|external-comment"
  perspective="collection|hierarchical|temporal"
  user={{permissions: [...], role: "..."}}
/>
```

### Content Context Selection
**Three Entry Points**:
- **ODP Edition** (primary): Published editions for formal review and consultation
- **Baseline** (advanced): Historical snapshots for cross-time analysis
- **Repository** (contributors): Live development content with latest versions

**Context Selector**: Dropdown interface with edition metadata (status, publication date, version)

### Mode Configurations
**Elaboration Mode**: Full CRUD operations on repository content
- Create, edit, delete operational requirements and changes
- Hierarchy management with REFINES relationships
- Version control and milestone management

**Read Mode**: View-only navigation for published editions
- Browse content structure and relationships
- Export and print capabilities
- Historical version access

**Internal Review Mode**: Review capabilities for internal stakeholders
- Content browsing with comment threading
- Review status controls and approval workflow
- Internal stakeholder notification system

**External Comment Mode**: Limited commenting for external stakeholders

## Design Patterns and Standards

### Navigation Consistency
**Application Header**: Persistent across all activities
- Clear activity identification
- One-click switching between activities
- User context and system status

**Activity Navigation**: Consistent patterns within activities
- Tab-based entity switching (Setup and ODP Browser)
- Perspective toggle with clear visual indicators
- Breadcrumb navigation for hierarchy
- Context preservation during navigation

### Responsive Design
**Mobile Considerations**:
- Horizontal scroll for entity tabs
- Collapsible filtering area for more screen space
- Touch-friendly group headers and action buttons
- Stacked layout for four-area Collection design
- Swipe gestures for perspective switching

**Desktop Optimization**:
- Full four-area Collection layout utilization

- Secondary actions: Import, Export, Group By, Filter
- Navigation actions: Perspective toggle, context selector

**Context Sensitivity**: Actions change based on selection and mode
- "Edit in Collection View" toggles entire interface mode
- Group By controls adapt to available columns for each entity type
- Bulk actions available when multiple items selected
- Single-item actions enabled/disabled based on selection state

### Visual Hierarchy
**Status Indicators**:
- Entity count badges on tabs and group headers

- Loading states during group expand/collapse

**Interaction Feedback**:
- Hover states for all interactive elements
- Loading states during API operations and group operations
- Success/error notifications with undo capabilities
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Group header expand/collapse animations

### Integration with Existing Patterns
**Component Reuse**:
- TreeEntity base class extended for hierarchical perspective
- Modal forms for complex CRUD operations
- Error handling and validation patterns from Setup Activity
- Responsive design tokens and styling system
- SharePoint Lists-inspired editing patterns in Collection perspective

**API Integration**:
- Multi-context parameter support for baseline/wave filtering
- Grouping query parameters for server-side grouping optimization
- Version history endpoints for temporal navigation
- Optimistic locking for concurrent editing in Collection edit mode
- Comment threading API for Review and Comment modes
