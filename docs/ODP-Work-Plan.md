# ODP Work Plan - Unified Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
Strategic implementation plan for the Operational Deployment Plan system, tracking progress across server backend, CLI, and web client development.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

### ✅ PHASE 1: Project Foundation
Docker environment, shared models package (@odp/shared), build pipeline, development tooling with hot reload and debugging support.

### ✅ PHASE 2: Core Storage Layer
BaseStore abstraction, entity stores for setup entities, content filtering, relationship management with parent/child hierarchies, transaction support with rollback capability.

### ✅ PHASE 3: Service Layer Architecture
BaseService pattern, complete CRUD with validation for all setup entities, wave management, dependency validation, transaction orchestration across multiple entities.

### ✅ PHASE 4: REST API Implementation
OpenAPI specification, Express route handlers for all entities, consistent error handling, request validation, standardized response formatting.

### ✅ PHASE 5: CLI Foundation
Commander.js framework, HTTP integration with API server, ASCII table output formatting, interactive modes for complex operations, 35+ commands covering all entities.

### ✅ PHASE 6: Advanced Features
DRG field addition to OR/OC, OperationalChange description→purpose rename, rich text fields (initialState, finalState, details), implementedONs relationship (OR→ON links), 5-event milestone system, content filtering extensions, shared module integration.

### ✅ PHASE 7: Bulk Import
OpenAPI import module (openapi-import.yml), ImportService with YAML parsing, dependency resolution via topological sorting, external ID to internal ID mapping, greedy error handling, setup and requirements import endpoints.

### ✅ PHASE 8: CLI Comprehensive Updates
OR/OC commands updated for new fields, DRG enum integration in interactive flows, milestone system updates, import commands (setup, requirements), comprehensive error reporting, end-to-end testing validation.

### ✅ PHASE 9: Import Changes Capability
Operational Changes import format definition, ImportService.importChanges method, milestone key generation, reference resolution (OR and wave), greedy processing with error collection, CLI import changes command with DRG parameter.

### ✅ PHASE 10: Export Capability
AsciiDoc generation for editions and repository, ODPEditionService.exportAsAsciiDoc method, Mustache template rendering, API endpoints (/odp-editions/{id}/export, /odp-editions/export), CLI export commands with STDOUT delivery.

### ✅ PHASE 11: Web Client Foundation
Vanilla JS infrastructure with ES modules, responsive design with shared CSS architecture, landing activity with navigation hub, connection status monitoring, user identification workflow.

### ✅ PHASE 12: Web Client Setup Activity
Complete CRUD interfaces for 4 setup entities (stakeholder categories, data categories, services, waves), hierarchy management with visual tree navigation, TreeEntity and ListEntity component patterns, client-side validation.

### ✅ PHASE 13: Web Client Elaboration Activity
Versioned operational entity management (OR/OC), milestone management with 5-event system, version history navigation, optimistic locking UI, CollectionEntity component pattern, advanced filtering and grouping.

### ✅ PHASE 14: Web Client Publication Activity
Baseline creation and management, ODPEdition creation with baseline and wave selection, wave filtering integration, baseline capture UI, edition-based filtering across OR/OC collections.

### ✅ PHASE 15: Web Client Review Activity
Repository review interface for entire ODP content, edition-based review with filtered views, comprehensive content display, navigation between review and elaboration contexts.

### ✅ PHASE 16: Web Client Advanced Features
Client-side filtering enhancements (type, text, DRG, categories), grouping capabilities (by type, DRG, etc.), performance optimization for 100+ items, filter persistence across navigation.

### ✅ PHASE 17: Web Client Temporal View
Timeline grid component for deployment visualization, pixmap milestone representation (3x3 grid), wave vertical lines, time window management (3-year default), dual selection support (change/milestone), connector lines showing deployment continuity.

### ✅ PHASE 18: Web Client Model Update
Shared module integration (@odp/shared imports), DRG enum centralization, milestone system updates (5 event types), visibility enum integration, form updates for new OR/OC fields (purpose, initialState, finalState, details), validation consistency across UI.

### ✅ PHASE 19: Model Update - Document References & Dependencies
**Removed:** RegulatoryAspect entity and all related endpoints, regulatoryAspect query parameters, CLI regulatory-aspects commands.
**Added:** Document entity with full CRUD (title, description, version, url), annotated document references (REFERENCES edges with notes), version dependencies (DEPENDS_ON relationships), privateNotes and path fields to OR/OC.
**Updated:** Store layer with DocumentStore and dependency methods, Service layer with DocumentService and reference validation, Route layer with /documents endpoints, CLI with document commands and updated OR/OC workflows, Web client with annotated-multiselect component, document management UI, and dependency tracking.
**Implementation:** Complete across all 5 layers (Store, Service, Route, CLI, Web Client). Empty database restart - no migration required.
